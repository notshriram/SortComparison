# SortComparison

Compares Various sorting algorithms on the basis of time taken to execute each of those algorithms.
This is in no way a serious project, lol. :satisfied:

### Prerequisites
* Windows 7 and up
* Visual studio 2019 (for modifying)

horribly written code with completely unnecessary classes for literally everything,
for instance:
```c++
class sortings{
public:
	std::array<int, 1000> arrayin;
	void populate();
	void bubblesort();
	void standardsort();};
```


### Installing
if you just want to see it working, clone this repository and open SortCompare.exe from ./SortComparison/Debug

Cheers! :muscle:
